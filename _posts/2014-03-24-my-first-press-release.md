Last month, I was featured in a Unicon, Inc. press release with a few of my fellow colleagues.

Here's my highlight:

> John Gasper comes to Unicon with 15 years in IT at Eastern Washington University and experience with Ellucian's Banner Student and Banner Enterprise Identity Services (BEIS); and Microsoft's Identity Lifecycle Manager (ILM) and AD Federation Services (ADFS). While at Eastern Washington University John developed and contributed ADFS support for the CAS server. He is currently contributing to Internet2â€™s Scalable Privacy project via the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) project.

I also like this quote:

> These new colleagues enhance Unicon's ability to deliver exceptional value across a range of open source IAM components," said Bill Thompson, IAM Practice Director.

I think it is so true. I belief the old and new IAM team members compliments each other very well.
