I love stumbling upon tidbits that make my life simpler. Colin Miller has several post on command-line hacks. Here's a couple I appreciate:

- [Bashmarks](http://colintmiller.com/upgrade-your-command-line-part-1-bashmarks/)
- [Super cd..](http://colintmiller.com/upgrade-your-command-line-part-2-super-cd/)
- [Better Prompt](http://colintmiller.com/upgrade-your-command-line-part-4-better-prompt/)

He also has an article on [tmux](http://colintmiller.com/upgrade-your-command-line-part-3-tmux/). I've been a fan of tmux for several years. It has lots of goodies, but my favorite by far is the ability to reattach to a session that got disrupted by a drop in mobile data or a wireless router/dsl modem reset.

A couple of other interesting tmux links:

- [Practical tmux](https://mutelight.org/practical-tmux)
- [How to scroll (with a note on mouse use)](http://superuser.com/questions/209437/how-do-i-scroll-in-tmux)
- ^b (space) = resizes the panes equally
- ^b z = toggles pane full screen
