title: Notes about Airports
---
These notes are mostly to remind myself of the various airports, but maybe helpful to others too.

# Denver (DEN)
Avoid at all cost; weather effects all the time (summer and winter)

# Salt Lake City (SLC)
weather affects it a lot; horrible WiFi (maybe just down by E gates);  

# San Jose (SJC)
long narrow airport; good WiFi; car rental on-site across the street from airport; 

# Spokane (GEG)
Good WiFi

# Seattle (SEA)
Good bagel place at D5/D6; Good WiFi
