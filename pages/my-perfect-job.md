title: My Perfect Job
---

The following is a list of things that I am looking for in my next (dream) job and things my future employer may want to know about me:

- Work Environment, Location, and Travel

  - Regular office/cubical work is not for me. The flexibility of remote work is great.
  - Regular travel is appreciated (up to once to twice per month; up to five weeks per quarter, preferably not back to back weeks).
  - Most work weeks should be around 40 hours, but you will get no complaints when outages or weekend migrations occur.
  - Flexible scheduling: I will attend all necessary meetings and I'm almost always available online even when not working, but sometimes I like to work early morning and sometimes I like to work late evenings.
  - I am a Mac guy that does a lot of virtual machine, Docker container work. My desired workstation is a Mac Book Pro with an at least a 0.5gb SSD and at least 16gb (preferably 32gb) of RAM.

- Project Management

  - I do decent project management. If there is a project management void with a project I tend to step into the role.
  - I am good juggling/prioritizing 4-8 projects on my own.
  - I stress when multiple projects are due around the same time, if there is no clear cut priority.

- Work style

  - I like to have several projects of different types to switch between.
  - I am an early adopter; I like to find new things and work them into processes where applicable. Once I have mastered, incorporated and evangelized the new tech, I'm ready to move on.
  - I can code, but I am not a coder. I generally consider myself a "process efficiency engineer/architect".

- Philosophies

  - I love making inefficient processes efficient.
  - I ask "why do we/you do that" a lot.
  - I believe in Open Source Software (OSS): using it, contributing to it, and starting new projects.
  - I believe in internal and external collaboration.
  - I hate politics, turf wars, and power games.

Almost everything on this list should be considered desired/negotiable, but this is me.
